# Health

The **health** section of the **devops.json** is to enable the discovery of any health services published by 
the component.  This specifies the name(s) of the health service 

**Note:** A health service should also be described in the OpenAPI document, which will 
provide more details.  

Like all sections, there is guide reference which can give further information
on how the section can be used.
